# Ray Optics Simulation
Simulate reflection and refraction of light.

## Features
- Simulate various light sources: ray, beam, and point source
- Simulate reflection in linear, circular, and parabolic mirror
- Simulate beam splitter
- Simulate refraction in linear or circular interfaces, including both refracted and reflected rays
- Simulate ideal lens/mirror, which obeys lens/mirror equation
- View extensions of rays to see if they converge to a virtual image
- View real images, virtual images, and virtual objects directly
- View images that can be observed from some given position
- Distance, angular, energy flow, and momentum flow measurements
- Export as SVG diagram

# Quick Start

Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/ricktu288/ray-optics.git`

Open `simulator/index.html` locally in you browser (or start an http server in the repo directory if "Sample" does not work).

# Making your own tools

The structure of a tool is described in [the template here](tool_template.js). To view the code of an existing tool, you can search for `objTypes['id_of_the_tool'] =` in [`index.js`](simulator/index.js).

| Name on the toolbar | ID of the tool |
| --- | --- |
| Ray | `laser` |
| Beam | `parallel` |
| Point source | `radiant` |
| Mirrors -> Segment | `mirror` |
| Mirrors -> Circular Arc | `arcmirror` |
| Mirrors -> Ideal Curved | `idealmirror` |
| Mirrors -> Parabolic | `parabolicmirror` |
| Mirrors -> Beam Splitter | `beamsplitter` |
| Glasses -> Half-plane | `halfplane` |
| Glasses -> Circle | `circlelens` |
| Glasses -> Free-shape | `refractor` |
| Glasses -> Ideal Lens | `lens` |
| Glasses -> Spherical Lens | `sphericallens` |
| Blocker | `blackline` |
| Ruler | `ruler` |
| Protractor | `protractor` |
| Detector | `power` |
| Text | `text` |

I'm sorry that most of the comments in [`index.js`](simulator/index.js) are in Chinese. For now, you can see [the template](tool_template.js) for some explanations in English.

## A way to quickly test your own tools

After you complete the code `objTypes['id_of_your_tool'] = {...};`, a quick way to test it without modifying the toolbar is to execute the code directly in your browser's developer tool. And when you want to choose the tool, execute `AddingObjType = 'id_of_your_tool'`.

## Putting your own tools into the toolbar

You can just search for an existing tool id such as `protractor` or `beamsplitter` in `simulator/ToolBarViewModel.js`, `simulator/index.html`, `simulator/index.js`, and `simulator/locales/en.js` and add the corresponding lines for your tools. And also include an exported SVG image (use the "export" button) of your tools in `img/id_of_your_tool.svg` cropped to a suitable size.

If you create a useful tool, please submit a pull request to let others use your tool! (We will add the Chinese locales for it.)
